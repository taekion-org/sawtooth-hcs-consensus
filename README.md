# Hedera Consensus Service (HCS) Consensus Engine for Hyperledger Sawtooth

## Introduction
This project (`sawtooth-hcs-consensus`) is a pluggable consensus engine for Hyperledger Sawtooth
that utilizes the Hedera Consensus Service (HCS) to provide publicly verifiable, Byzantine
Fault Tolerant consensus to Sawtooth-based blockchains.

## Requirements
This consensus engine requires the Sawtooth nodes to have a reliable connection to the public Internet
and the ability to connect to the Hedera public APIs.
